This repository contains the Mathematica implementation of the algorithm presented in the paper titled "An algorithm for computing the singularities of the plane model of  $X_0(N)$".

SingularitiesPara_en.nb：Parallel Wolfram Language implementation of an explicit CM-based algorithm to enumerate all non-cuspidal singularities (nodes) of the plane model Z_0(l) of the modular curve  X_0(l) for prime l
, returning the corresponding distinct preimage pairs on X_0(l). 

data.zip:The output files in .nb form for primes $\ell\le 101$, Here ``output pairs'' refers to collision/preimage pairs $(\tau_i,\tau_j)$ returned by the implementation (i.e.\ distinct points of $X_0(\ell)$ with identical images in $Z_0(\ell)$).

Singularities389.txt:The  output files in .txt form for primes $\ell=389$.
